## Definitions

The team rates vulnerabilities on a scale from a low to critical risk, depending on the level of impact and exploitability of the vulnerability.
Impact

The table below details the risk classification matrix used to rate vulnerabilities based on their Impact vs. Exploitability.

| Level  | Definition of criticality level |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|[Critical]{color="purple"} |Exploitation is straightforward and usually results in system-level compromise. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch immediately. |
|[High]{color="red"}     	|Exploitation is more difficult but could cause elevated privileges and potentially a loss of data or downtime. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch as soon as possible. |
|[Medium]{color="orange"}   |Vulnerabilities exist but are not exploitable or require extra steps such as social engineering. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch after high-priority issues have been resolved. |
|[Low]{color="blue"}         	|Vulnerabilities are non-exploitable but would reduce an organizationâ€™s attack surface. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch during the next maintenance window. |
|[Info]{color="green"}|No vulnerability exists. Additional information is provided regarding items noticed during testing, strong controls, and additional documentation. |

| Level  | Definition of exploitability level |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|[User]{color="purple"}| **The exploitation of the vulnerability requires only basic levels of skills and means.** This implies that the exploitation is easy. |
|[Techincal]{color="red"}| **The exploitation of the vulnerability requires the skills and means of a technical person.** This implies capabilities of developing a utility to exploit the vulnerability without necessarily having significant means. |
|[Hacker]{color="orange"}  | **The exploitation of the vulnerability requires the skills of a hacker.** This implies a considerable knowledge in information systems security. |
